## Overview  

**School Manager** is a modern web application designed to simplify school administration by providing tools for managing students, teachers, courses, and schedules. This project is inspired by the [LamaDev video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/c/LamaDev), and Iâ€™ve added my own custom features and designs to enhance its functionality and usability.

Built with **React**, **Next.js**, and a powerful backend, the School Manager is a scalable solution for educational institutions of all sizes.
